// closure are functions that remember the env they were created in and can ref indpdnt variable in that env
//closures enable creation of function factories
// function factories: we can create funcs that return other functions to make adaptable methods


let call=() => {
  let secret = 'ES6 Rocks';   //only within the closure scope
  let reveal = () => {
    console.log(secret);
  }
  reveal();
}
call();                 // but accessing it in globalscope


---------------------------------------
// lexical scoping : track of the loc of var so that it can be accesssed

let call=() => {
  let secret = 'ES6 Rocks';   
  let reveal = () => {
    console.log(secret);

let unveil = call();
unveil();  // closure retains a ref to the LS env it was created in and allows us to access data within scopes of functions
